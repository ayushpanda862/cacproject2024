                <h2>Types of Legislative Documents</h2>
<p>In the legislative process, Congress utilizes several types of documents to propose, debate, and enact laws. These include bills, which are proposed laws; resolutions, which express opinions or set internal rules; treaties, which are formal agreements between nations; and nominations, which involve the appointment of individuals to government positions. Each type of document serves a distinct purpose in shaping federal policy and governance.</p>
